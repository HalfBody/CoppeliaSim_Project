# CoppeliaSim_Project
KuKauBot with Fuzzy and probably SLAM

# FOR THOSE WHO WILL BE WATCHING
 - This work is a small scene with a yobot and a couple of obstacles
A two-mode control system is written for the robot
Evasion from obstacles is organized on fuzzy logic
The part with communication and functions related to the functions of the coppelia is placed in a separate file "server" 
All fuzzy logic was put in a separate file
The main script is "try.py"
The libraries used will be listed later
